🎯 Job Application Tracker – Your Career Companion
Job Application Tracker is a stylish and intuitive Flask web app crafted to empower job seekers. Say goodbye to scattered spreadsheets and endless tabs—this tool brings every application into one beautiful, easy-to-navigate space, storing your data in a clean applications.xlsx format.


🌟 Why It’s Awesome
🚀 Career Dashboard: Instantly spot how many roles you’ve applied to, which ones are in progress, and those awaiting response—your journey, mapped out beautifully.

✨ Quick Entry: Add new applications in seconds—just ID, company, title, and status—so you stay focused on opportunity, not on data entry.

🛠️ Effortless Edits: Change status, update job titles, or edit company names via a sleek interface that keeps your tracker accurate and fresh.

🗑️ Organized Cleanup: Easily delete stale or irrelevant entries to keep your list sharp and relevant.

📊 Consolidated List View: View all your job apps in a neat table—you can sort, scan, or bulk assess your progress at a glance.

🔍 Smart Search (Track by ID): Remember one application’s ID? That’s all it takes to instantly bring up its full details—great for quick reference or recruiter follow-ups.

👑 Admin Security: A password-protected admin panel ensures only you (or trusted teammates) can access and manage application data.
